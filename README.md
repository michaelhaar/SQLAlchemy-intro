# SQLAlchemy-intro
This project was part of my Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. In this miniproject we used SQLAlchemy to perform CRUD operations on a database.

## Installing the Virtual Machine
We are using a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a Python script that uses it. The VM is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer. The required steps to setup the virtual machine can be found in the separated [vm-setup.md](https://github.com/michi1992/SQLAlchemy-intro/blob/master/vm-setup.md) file.
